# 3D Modeling Project: Cube & Radio (High/Low Poly)

This repository contains a Blender project created for a 3D modeling course. It includes two primary models: a cube and a radio, each provided in both high poly and low poly versions.

## Project Overview

- **Cube Model**: 
  - High Poly: A detailed cube with enhanced edge definition and additional subdivisions.
  - Low Poly: A simplified version of the cube, optimized for performance.

- **Radio Model**:
  - High Poly: A complex, highly detailed model of a radio, featuring intricate details and realistic textures.
  - Low Poly: A more basic version of the radio, designed for use in real-time applications where performance is crucial.
